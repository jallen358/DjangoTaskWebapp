### **Project Flow for Developing the Cloud-Based Task Management System**

### **High-Level Diagram Overview**

1. **User Interaction Layer:** The frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) provides a responsive UI for user interaction.
2. **API Gateway:** Django REST Framework and FastAPI expose APIs for frontend communication.
3. **Monolithic Core:** Django handles core functionalities, including task management and database interactions.
4. **Microservices:** FastAPI services handle specific high-performance tasks.
5. **Database:** PostgreSQL stores all persistent data.
6. **Containerization and Orchestration:** Docker containers run the application components, managed by Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.
7. **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automates testing and deployment.
8. **Cloud Infrastructure:** Azure provides the environment for hosting and running the application, including virtual machines and Kubernetes services.

#### **Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Gathering**
1. **[[Project Requirements|Define Objectives and Scope]]**
   - Clearly outline the project goals
   - Identify and document the key features and functionalities required.
   - Determine the scope of the project, including both essential and optional features.

2. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - Backend: Django for core features, FastAPI for microservices.
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   - Database: PostgreSQL.
   - Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes.
   - CI/CD: GitHub Actions.
   - Deployment: Microsoft Azure.

3. **Project Timeline and Milestones**
   - Break down the project into phases with clear milestones (e.g., backend completion, frontend integration, API development, containerization, deployment).
   - Set deadlines for each milestone to keep the project on track.

#### **Phase 2: System Design**
1. **Architectural Design**
   - Design the overall system architecture, including the monolithic core (Django) and microservices (FastAPI).
   - Create a high-level diagram showing how components interact.

1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Design the PostgreSQL database schema, including tables for users, tasks, comments, notifications, etc.
   - Define relationships and constraints between tables.

2. **API Design**
   - Outline the RESTful API endpoints using Django REST Framework and FastAPI.
   - Plan for API versioning and documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger.

3. **Containerization Strategy**
   - Plan the Docker setup, including Dockerfiles and Docker Compose for multi-container management.
   - Prepare Kubernetes manifests for deployment in a scalable manner.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Design**
   - Design the CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, including steps for testing, building, and deploying the application.

#### **Phase 3: Implementation**
1. **Backend Development**
   - **[[Django Core]]:**
     - Implement authentication, user roles, task creation, and management features.
     - Integrate with PostgreSQL, creating the database and setting up models.
   - **FastAPI Microservices:**
     - Develop microservices for notifications, analytics, or other performance-critical tasks.
     - Ensure asynchronous processing for real-time features.

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Design a responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implement AJAX for dynamic task updates and notifications.
   - Ensure seamless integration with the backend APIs.

3. **API Development**
   - **Django REST Framework:** Implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on tasks, users, and comments.
   - **FastAPI:** Develop additional APIs for high-performance tasks, ensuring they are well-documented.

4. **Containerization**
   - Dockerize the Django application, FastAPI services, PostgreSQL, and any other dependencies.
   - Set up Docker Compose to manage multi-container environments during development.

5. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Deploy the Dockerized application to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Configure scaling, load balancing, and monitoring within Kubernetes.

#### **Phase 4: Testing**
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all Django and FastAPI components to validate individual functionalities.
   - Ensure all tests pass before moving to integration.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the interaction between different components, ensuring they work together as expected.
   - Focus on testing APIs, database interactions, and frontend-backend communication.

3. **Load and Performance Testing**
   - Perform load testing to ensure the application can handle the expected number of users.
   - Optimize performance where necessary, especially for API endpoints.

4. **Security Testing**
   - Conduct security tests to ensure user data is protected and vulnerabilities are addressed.
   - Implement any necessary security features, such as OAuth2 or two-factor authentication.

#### **Phase 5: Deployment**
1. **Azure Environment Setup**
   - Set up Azure virtual machines, databases, and storage resources.
   - Configure the environment for optimal performance and security.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Implement the CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions, automating testing, building, and deployment processes.
   - Deploy the application to Azure, ensuring all components are correctly configured and functional.

3. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Verify that the deployed application works correctly in the production environment.
   - Conduct additional performance and security testing in the live environment.

#### **Phase 6: Maintenance and Monitoring**
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Monitor, Kubernetes dashboards) to track application performance and health.
   - Monitor logs and alerts to detect and respond to any issues promptly.

2. **Bug Fixes and Updates**
   - Regularly update the application to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features.
   - Use GitHub for version control, managing updates through pull requests and the CI/CD pipeline.

3. **User Feedback and Iteration**
   - Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
   - Plan and implement iterative updates to enhance the application based on feedback.

#### **Phase 7: Documentation and Collaboration**
1. **Technical Documentation**
   - Document the system architecture, API endpoints, database schema, and deployment process.
   - Create user manuals and setup guides for future developers and users.

2. **Collaboration Tools**
   - Use GitHub for issue tracking, code reviews, and team communication.
   - Maintain clear and thorough communication with team members and stakeholders throughout the project.
